First, thanks for downloading the Bathroom Kit For Him and NightWolf3D hope that you will be satisfied by yours renders


1)Technical notes :

a) Mesh :

The main folder contains two sub-folders : "LowPoly" and "HighPoly" wich contain each one an Universal materials folder

-Bathroom Kit For Him LowPoly : (2219 polygons and 2290 vertices)

-Bathroom Kit For Him HighPoly : (34236 polygons and 34341 vertices)

-Maya and OBJ : An object format version is delivered* if your are not a Maya user, you can import it in any software and the textures are provided.
 Yours meshs are UV-mapped and textured too.

*You'll find it in the "OBJ" folder


b) Materials and texturing :

You have 1 version of materials
-Universal materials : You can use it in any rendering engine and any 3D software
-Textures : You have all your textures in the "Bitmap" folder and in "OBJ" folders


c) Using :

Every version is ready for use, you don't have to texturing and mapping it

-Bathroom Kit For Him LowPoly : The Maya version is set to smooth preview with a 0 for preview division to save your system resources. 
First, place it in your scene and render it with your favorite rendering engine(Mental Ray, Maya Software etc, Blender Internal, Vray etc...) and it will appear like an smooth mesh.

-Bathroom Kit For Him HighPoly : Like the lowpoly version, it's directly usable.

-Mental Ray engine : For a better use, NightWolf3D advise you to set Mental Ray on "Production : Fine Trace" then activate the "Final Gathering" 
in "Indirect Lighting" for a nice lighting in your scene.
